# Premierleaguenews
A simple project Android use Retrofit and Material Design

This app use free api from http://www.football-data.org
To protect the API from unnecessary load it is throttled. Non-authenticated clients are allowed for 100 requests per 24 hours,
which is enough to see if itâ€™s worth registering. Registered clients are allowed for 50 requests per minute by default. 
However, only rarely there is need for such high rates, so if one of my guarding-algorithms detects abnormal or foolish requests,
I will first try to contact you via mail to try to find out the reasons for your load. Mostly some sort of caching resolves the issue, 
sometimes I loosen rate limits. However, depending on the load and your response time I may suspend your account and/or ban your IP.
But you can register many api-keys from https://www.football-data.org/client/register.
You can use current api-key that i have created or use you own api key then change it on https://github.com/hungvu193/Premierleaguenews/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml at .
